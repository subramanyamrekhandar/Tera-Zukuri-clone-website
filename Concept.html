Without their support this project would have not come to life. The story started in 2016, when I traveled to the Middle East and encountered a high quality Kashmir Shawl. Back then, I knew nothing about high quality Kashmir products. Admittedly, without being to touch and feel the high and lower quality Kashmir, I would not have known the difference without physical comparison. Falling in love with the shawl s quality and the love put into its creation, I decided to purchase it as a present for my mother. Fast forward to year 2017, I was fortunate to meet with Ms. Mook. A dealer who had worked with pashmina since year 2000, and had become part of the Mia family of the Kashmir artisans. It was the first time I was able to have a detailed look of multiple pashmina work - many of them displayed the techniques such as embodiment and Kani. These techniques are artwork in themselves. With much enthusiasm and similar love of the pashmina craft, Ms. Mook and I became close. As it appears that there are still a lot of people who do not know about the craft of pashmina, I wish to spread the word and support these artists. It is with the support of the Mia family that the Tera project has come to life.</h5>

                 <h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  " >Fine natural material combined with passion and mindfulness, these are what materialized every Tera pashmina. In the early stages, I did not plan to alter the traditional product. However after some use, I have noticed some small details that can be improved upon.</h5>
                 <br><h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">The traditional size comes at 2 meters long by 1 meter wide for the shawl and 2 meters long and 75 centimeters wide for the traditional stole. We want the pashmina to fit the modern casual wear. Not too long, which would make it hard to manage or messy when wearing, but long enough to be able to cover the whole body with just enough space for the “flow” edge. Because of both the size and double mid section, it was not possible to set the thread with the current loom, so a new loom must be constructed to accommodate this project. As noted previously, these products are all made by hand from beginning to the end, and as this is a collaborative effort of many artisans, there might be slight variation in the finished product. However, in this very high quality material and process, only the high skill craftsman would be able to made the product in accordance with a quality control specified by Tera.
                 </h5><br>
                 <h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">One of the most difficult properties to achieve in the creation of this product is the thinness of the pashmina itself. This can only come from tremendous effort to spin the threads as small as possible while maintaining their strength. To succeed one requires experience and skills accumulated over many years. This make the cloth light weight and allows it to flow elegantly when a person moves or when the breeze picks up. However, initially we found that thinning the thread came with a downside. Even when the shawl covered the whole body, it still allowed the cold to penetrate. A possible solution was to weave a “double weave” where 30% of the thread is added to increase the thickness, but this sacrifices the light weight. With this in mind, we searched for a solution - and we found it! We discovered that “doubling” only a certain middle part of the cloth makes sure that the part that covers your body will be thicker, while the edge of the cloth will remain in single weave. This customization requires a lot of adjustment in the hand weaving process, but with all the effort, it means that our pashmina will still be able to flow elegantly while being able to keep you warm.</h5>
                 <br><h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">Beauty and Practicality are the concepts I always keep in mind. Being someone who loves everyday practical tools, products which follow their function have always been my obsession. Because I believe that using a product gives it the life it deserves, the Tera scarf must be practical and able to serve its core purpose. I will admit that I am no expert in fashion, therefore I have asked a friend Bam, who is a fashion designer, to help me refine and turn my idea into a real product. The hardest aspect is to get the balance “just right”. The Tera scarf must be long enough to cover you elegantly, but shot enough to not be untidy. Thick enough to keep you warm, yet light enough to flow effortlessly in the wind. However, this is as far as we can go. All this effort will not be complete without our customers - you. Because you will be the one who gives this product the chance to embrace and give someone warmth. You will be the one who allows it to flow elegantly in the wind. You will be the one who brings it to life.</h5>
