      <h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">The pashmina Craft had its beginning in the Persian empire. The story goes that in the 15th century a very skilled family moved to the Kashmir region from Persian, and introduced the craft to the region. With the influence of King Zayn Ul Abdin, it turned into a popular product used by the nobles as a functional wardrobe and to protect them against the harsh weather of the Kashmir region. There are many different grades of pashmina. Even within one animal, they also contain different hair quality. The novice would practice with lower quality fabric and only with the skilled hands of a veteran could the thinnest quality fabric shine as a finished product. These high quality shawls became a family heirloom passed from mother to daughter during the marriage. They also became selected as present to the honorable guest.</h5>
      <br>
      <h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">
      Pashmina was initially introduced to Europe as a gift to the royal family. It was not until the late 18th century that pashmina become a popular accessory for the nobles In Europe. The French empress Joséphine, one of the big collectors of the Kashmir high quality pashmina, helped popularize the fabric during 19th century.></h5>
      <br>
      <h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">The traditional size comes at 2 meters long by 1 meter wide for the shawl and 2 meters long and 75 centimeters wide for the traditional stole. We want the pashmina to fit the modern casual wear. Not too long, which would make it hard to manage or messy when wearing, but long enough to be able to cover the whole body with just enough space for the “flow” edge. Because of both the size and double mid section, it was not possible to set the thread with the current loom, so a new loom must be constructed to accommodate this project. As noted previously, these products are all made by hand from beginning to the end, and as this is a collaborative effort of many artisans, there might be slight variation in the finished product. However, in this very high quality material and process, only the high skill craftsman would be able to made the product in accordance with a quality control specified by Tera.
      </h5>
      <br>
      <h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;">With many prototypes, trial and error, we believe that our product is now worthy of being a treasure to our customers. Moving forward, it is our commitment to continue to strive in improving and perfecting our product. Please look forward to our work in the future.</h5>
