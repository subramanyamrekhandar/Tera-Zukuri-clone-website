During the process, soft pashmina hair is mixed with the harder outer hair called “guard hair”. Harvesting is usually done outside the village or city. Raw materials are then transferred to the village for the next stages.</h5>

                 <h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">After materials arrive at the village, preparation begins by a hitting process. This is done to clean, fluff and stabilize the material. The raw fur is hit by big rope with two men on each side. The process can take 2-3 days in the middle of the sun.</h5>

                 <h5  style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">After the initial preparation its time for sorting; the process where guard hair is separated from the softer pashmina.After the guard hair is removed, the soft hair(Phumb) goes to combing.Combing is a method to remove the impurities and parallelize the raw fiber.The comb is set upright, then the tuft is decided by hand.The process is repeated 3 - 4 times until the material is pure according to a high standard.</h5>
                 <br>
                 <h5  style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  "><b>Next is the seasoning process called “Kharioat”. Here powdered rice (kharioat) is applied on the material and left for around two nights. This process helps improves the softness, strength and moisture of the material. After gluing, it is then combed again to remove extra glue. The finished thumb is transfer to the spinning process. The material in this stage itself is called pashm, (which means soft gold). After this material is prepared it is weighted to be distributed into other processes.</b></h5>

                 <h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  " >The most difficult process to master. Here is where skill matters and determines the quality of the final product. The raw fabric is so fine that with the strength of most machines, the spinners will damage the structure of fiber. Moreover, the thread is inconsistent by nature. The thickness of each part must be felt and transformed by a hand that understands the nature of each part of the fabric itself.</h5>
                 <br><h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">The first wheel used in the spinning process is the bigger wheel - Charkha. The left hand holds the tuft, while the right hand turns the Charkha itself; the spinner lifts and lowers their hands as the wheel turns, controlling just the right amount of material into each spin and making it into the yarn.
                 </h5><br>
                 <h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">The yarn then goes to a double twist process on the tool called “phumblet”. After this, it returns to the Charkha for more twisting to strengthen it. After these processes, it is then made into hanks with a tool call Yarandul.</h5>
                 <br><h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">The total spinning process itself taking around 2 months to complete. The process requires a lot skills and care. The average age of the ladies who do this process for pashmina are around 45-50 years old, while the younger are responsible for and practice their craft with other types of wool.</h5>
                 <br><h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">The hanks are washed and cleaned in a mild mixture of soap and warm water. At this point, it is ready to be transferred to the weaving process. If needed to be dyed, the yarn is sent to Rangraz. The dying process uses colour extract from plants, which will not harm the fabric or cause skin irritation. From this unique process, there will be slight variations in colour as there are many factors which effect the changes.</h5>

                 <h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  " >Before weaving, the artisans must first consider the pattern of the weave and then set the yarn and loom accordingly. For the yarn, two artisans must work together and walk around a long wooden tool call prech, to set up the warp or the based thread. Depending on the size, the artisan must work these threads around 1000 times to set up this process. The finished warp are called Yaen and usually are long enough to produce 3-4 pieces of shawl.
                </h5>
                 <br>
                 <h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">After the Yaen are ready, the loom is set up for the next stage. These looms are traditionally constructed with the wood. How the loom is set up determines the size, dimension and pattern of the weave in the final product. For Tera, because the specification of the the final product itself, the new loom must be constructed in order to accommodate the nontraditional dimension. After determining the pattern on the loom, the artisans fix each Yaen to the loom handle according to the designed pattern. This process of loom setting itself takes around 7 days.</h5>
                 <br><h5 style="font-family: Crete Round,serif; font-style: italic;  ">
                    After the the loom is all set up, the artisans then start the weaving process. This is usually done by experienced men. The weave itself can be tight or loose, depending upon the strength of individual weaver. With all manual tools, the result are such as how handwriting of people are different. There are complexities in making multiple patterns. Even for the the most skillful weave like “kani” techniques, each individual shawl takes 2 years to complete. One uniqueness of these weaves is how thin they could be, while keeping reasonable strong. To make weave thin, the weaver must apply just right amount of strength into each weave, too strong it will be too tight and damage the very fine fiber itself; too weak and it will be too loose and unstable. It is this balance and consistency that make skill very crucial in the lengthy production. As the Yaen are set up to weave around 3-4 pieces in one go; after two weeks, we finally get to see the final product come to life.</h5>
